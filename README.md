# Fibonacci numbers, for EMC / Virtustream tech screen.  J Pocahontas Olson   June 2016
This directory contains a machine learning investigation of Fibonacci numbers, written in python.
Future plans include making a simple resting web app for Fibonacci numbers, written in python and flask.

To run:
    At a command line on a terminal, enter:
            python fibonacci.py

This executes a python script where the Fibonacci numbers are calculated and prints out a few.
